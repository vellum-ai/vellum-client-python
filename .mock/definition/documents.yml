        This is a multipart/form-data request. The `contents` field should be a
        file upload. It also expects a JSON body with the following fields:

        - `add_to_index_names: list[str]` - Optionally include the names of all
        indexes that you'd like this document to be included in

        - `external_id: str | None` - Optionally include an external ID for this
        document. This is useful if you want to re-upload the same document
        later when its contents change and would like it to be re-indexed.

        - `label: str` - A human-friendly name for this document. Typically the
        filename.

        - `keywords: list[str] | None` - Optionally include a list of keywords
        that'll be associated with this document. Used when performing keyword
        searches.

        - `metadata: dict[str, Any]` - A stringified JSON object containing any
        metadata associated with the document that you'd like to filter upon
        later.
