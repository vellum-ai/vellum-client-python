    ## Vellum API Documentation

    ### Welcome 👋
    Welcome to Vellum's API documentation! Here you'll find information about the various endpoints available to you,
    as well as the parameters and responses that they accept and return.

    We will be exposing more and more of our APIs over time as they stabilize. If there is some action you can perform
    via the UI that you wish you could perform via API, please let us know and we can expose it here in an unstable state.

    ### API Stability
    Some of the APIs documented within are undergoing active development. Use the
    <strong style="background-color:#4caf50; color:white; padding:4px; border-radius:4px">GA</strong>
    and
    <strong style="background-color:#ffc107; color:white; padding:4px; border-radius:4px">Beta</strong>
    tags to differentiate between those that are stable and those that are not.

    ### Base URLs
    Some endpoints are hosted separately from the main Vellum API and therefore have a different base url. If this is
    the case, they will say so in their description.

    Unless otherwise specified, all endpoints use <code>https://api.vellum.ai</code> as their base URL.

    ### Official API Clients:
    Vellum maintains official API clients for Python and Node/Typescript. We recommend using these clients to interact
    with all stable endpoints. You can find them here:
    - [Python](https://github.com/vellum-ai/vellum-client-python)
    - [Node/Typescript](https://github.com/vellum-ai/vellum-client-node)

  /v1/deployments/provider-payload:
    post:
      operationId: retrieve_provider_payload
      description: |
        Given a set of input variable values, compile the exact payload that Vellum would send to the configured model provider
        for execution if the execute-prompt endpoint had been invoked. Note that this endpoint does not actually execute the
        prompt or make an API call to the model provider.

        This endpoint is useful if you don't want to proxy LLM provider requests through Vellum and prefer to send them directly
        to the provider yourself. Note that no guarantees are made on the format of this API's response schema, other than
        that it will be a valid payload for the configured model provider. It's not recommended that you try to parse or
        derive meaning from the response body and instead, should simply pass it directly to the model provider as is.

        We encourage you to seek advise from Vellum Support before integrating with this API for production use.

        Upload a document to be indexed and used for search.

        **Note:** Uses a base url of `https://documents.vellum.ai`.

        This is a multipart/form-data request. The `contents` field should be a file upload. It also expects a JSON body with the following fields:
        - `add_to_index_names: list[str]` - Optionally include the names of all indexes that you'd like this document to be included in
        - `external_id: str | None` - Optionally include an external ID for this document. This is useful if you want to re-upload the same document later when its contents change and would like it to be re-indexed.
        - `label: str` - A human-friendly name for this document. Typically the filename.
        - `keywords: list[str] | None` - Optionally include a list of keywords that'll be associated with this document. Used when performing keyword searches.
        - `metadata: dict[str, Any]` - A stringified JSON object containing any metadata associated with the document that you'd like to filter upon later.
